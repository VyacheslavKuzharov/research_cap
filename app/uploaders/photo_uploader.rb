  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  # def store_dir
  #   "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{model.id}"
  # end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  def default_url(*args)
    'http://res.cloudinary.com/dawid4qiq/image/upload/v1494682181/news-logo-small_b61nx5.png'
  end

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process scale: [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :small do
    process resize_to_fill: [70, 70]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_whitelist
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end
